# Asset telemetry

This article explains how to use MQTT Broker and data flows to move application telemetry through the previously configured Purdue network. The process starts with an asset deployed in Purdue level2 and moves data from cluster to cluster, eventually landing in the cloud. At each cluster, a transformation adds new information to show how you can layer contextualization throughout the system. For example, an asset might send information from the Panels Creation Manufacturing Cell, but the asset itself doesn't know this context. Adding context at the cluster is a good option.

This article isn't a definitive guide or a production configuration. For core concepts, see the [Azure IoT Operations documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-operations/discover-manage-assets/overview-manage-assets).

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure the following prerequisites are in place:

An Event Hubs namespace is created with these configurations:

- Local authentication is enabled
- The standard pricing tier is in use (other tiers can work)
- The target Event Hub is created within the namespace
- You have access to the Azure portal and rights to add users to the Azure Event Hubs Data Sender role
- Public access is enabled for networking (all networks are used, but you should limit access to selected networks)
- The Event Hub status is enabled


## Add the AIO deployments to a single site

This article focuses on techniques to set up a layered network. The examples use clusters in a single factory called site-1. For this article, the admin already created a site named site-1, scoped to the entire subscription. All clusters deployed in the same subscription are part of that site, as shown here.

1. Go to the [Azure IoT Operations](https://iotoperations.azure.com/) portal

    ![Screenshot of Azure IoT Operations portal main dashboard showing site navigation.](./images/aio-portal-dashboard.png)

    If the site isn't already created, you can find your clusters under unassigned instances.

    ![Screenshot of Azure IoT Operations portal showing unassigned instances section.](./images/aio-portal-unassigned-instances.png)

1. Select site-1 to show the clusters created on level2, level3, and level4.

    ![Screenshot of Azure IoT Operations site-1 showing all three cluster levels.](./images/aio-site1-cluster-list.png)

1. When the following steps say to go to the cluster, select the link with the instance name below it to show the screen for that cluster.

    ![Screenshot of Azure IoT Operations cluster detail view showing instance overview.](./images/aio-cluster-detail-view.png)

## Deploying the Sample Asset on level2

The level2 cluster will have the OPC PLC simulator deployed to it to generate the required telemetry data that will be sent up through the parent clusters eventually landing in the cloud.

1. To deploy the OPC PLC simulator for use in sending telemetry to the cloud run the following commands from the jump box.

    ```bash
    kubectl config use-context level2
        kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/explore-iot-operations/main/samples/quickstarts/opc-plc-deployment.yaml
    ```

    ![Terminal output showing successful deployment of OPC PLC simulator](./images/kubectl-opc-plc-deployment-output.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > It is important to note that this configuration uses a self-signed application instance certificate. Don't use this configuration in a production environment. To learn more, see [Configure OPC UA certificates infrastructure for the connector for OPC UA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-operations/discover-manage-assets/howto-configure-opcua-certificates-infrastructure).

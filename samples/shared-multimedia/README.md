## Introducing Azure IoT Operations

Introducing Azure IoT Operations, the latest addition to the Azure IoT portfolio of products and services. 

Azure IoT Operations is an industrial cloud to edge data and messaging plane, enabled by Azure Arc. With its modular services organizations can build interoperable digital solutions that transform physical operations at scale. Azure IoT Operations creates edge-intelligent feedback loops to help diverse professionals to collaborate and solve operational problems faster.


## Azure IoT Operations Demo

Organizations need visibility in their operations to optimize processes, save costs, and increase safety. Often, digital solutions developed to achieve this visibility are built on siloed, proprietary technology stacks resulting in burdensome ecosystems, disconnected insights, and difficulty scaling solutions across multiple facilities.  

Azure IoT Operations is composed of modular services that help organizations discover devices, capture insights, and take actions to optimize their operations.

1. Unified management of equipment, infrastructure, and apps
2. A seamless modular experience
3. Interoperable services that streamline integration 
4. Democratize operational data
5. Consistently build applications for scale

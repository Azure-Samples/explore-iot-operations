# GRPC/HTTP Callout Server

GRPC/HTTP Callout Server is a server for testing the http and grpc callout capabilities of the Azure IoT Operations data processor.

## Usage

### Server as a Pod

```sh
# From the root of the http-grpc-callout directory.
docker build ../.. -f Dockerfile -t <yourcrhere>.azurecr.io/http-grpc-callout:latest

# Or if running from the root of the explore-iot-operations repository.
# docker build . -f ./samples/http-grpc-callout/Dockerfile -t <yourcrhere>.azurecr.io/http-grpc-callout:latest

# Push or load your newly built image into your cluster, depending on the k8s setup.
# docker push <yourcrhere>.azurecr.io/http-grpc-callout:latest # Using AKS + Connected ACR
# minikube load <yourcrhere>.azurecr.io/http-grpc-callout:latest # Using minikube
# docker save <yourcrhere>.azurecr.io/http-grpc-callout:latest | k3s ctr images import - # Using K3s

kubectl run http-grpc-callout --image=<yourcrhere>.azurecr.io/http-grpc-callout:latest --stdin < config.yml
```

# auth-server-template

This example is a template server for E4K broker custom authentication. Custom authentication allows a third-party server to decide whether to authenticate connecting MQTT clients. The server template provided here can be used as a starting point for implementing the authentication logic.

## Deploying the template

The template server needs to be built and deployed as a Kubernetes service. You will need to provide the repository for hosting its container image.

1. Run the [build_image.sh](deploy/build_image.sh) script and pass the image tag to use. This script builds and pushes the template image.

```sh
IMAGE_TAG=example.example.io/auth-server-template:latest ./deploy/build_image.sh
```

2. Run the [make_credentials.sh](deploy/make_credentials.sh) script to generate server credentials for the template. This script generates test certificates and saves them as Kubernetes secrets.

```sh
./deploy/make_credentials.sh
```

3. Edit [auth-server-template.yaml](deploy/auth-server-template.yaml#L10) and set the image that you created in step 1.

4. Deploy the pod and service for the template.

```sh
kubectl apply -f ./deploy/auth-server-template.yaml
```

5. When finished, run [cleanup.sh](deploy/cleanup.sh) to delete resources.

## Using the template

Add the custom authentication method to your E4K [values.yaml](https://github.com/Azure/E4K/blob/main/charts/E4K/values.yaml#L190). An example of the fields to add is below:

```yaml
authenticationMethods:
  - method: custom
    # Required, must match the pod name in auth-server-template.yaml
    endpoint: https://auth-server-template
    # Optional; this example uses the client cert generated by make_credentials.sh
    auth:
      type: x509
      source: k8s
      secret: custom-auth-client-cert
    # Required, as this template uses a self-signed CA.
    ca_cert: custom-auth-ca
```

The auth server template will approve authentication requests from all clients, except clients providing usernames that start with `deny`.
